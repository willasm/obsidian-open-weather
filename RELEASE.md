# Release Notes

<!-- ## [v-inc] ${YEAR4}-${MONTHNUMBER}-${DATE} -->

## [1.1.0] 2022-02-07
### Added
- Now runs on mobile (Display weather in statusbar is disabled)
- New setting `Exclude Folder` which will exclude a folder from automatic template strings replacement (set this to your templates folder so it does not replace the strings in your template)

### Fixed
- Dynamic weather in DIV's should be shown more reliably
