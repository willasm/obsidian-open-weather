# Release Notes

<!-- ## [v-inc] ${YEAR4}-${MONTHNUMBER}-${DATE} -->
## [1.7.0] 2024-02-18
### Added
- Settings for Latitude and Longitude
  - Note that these will override the location setting when these are defined
  - Use these if you are having issues with getting data returned for the wrong city when cities have identical names
  - Leave them blank to use the location setting
- The weather string placeholders `%latitude%` and `%longitude%`
  - These values are returned from the API call and are not from the new settings for Latitude and Longitude
