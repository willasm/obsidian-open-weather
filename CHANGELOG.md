## [1.7.1] 2024-02-24
### Fixed
- String settings names were named incorrectly (This effectively reset your defined strings to defaults)
  - The original edited strings are still in the data file, this fix just points back to them
  - This only affects anyone who had changed the default strings

## [1.7.0] 2024-02-18
### Added
- Settings for Latitude and Longitude
  - Please note that API requests by city name have been deprecated although they are still available for use
  - Note that setting these will override the location setting
  - Use these if you are having issues with getting data returned for the wrong city
  - Leave them blank to use the location setting (Not recommended)
- `Geocoding API` - This provides you with the requested cities name, state, country, latitude and longitude
- Settings button for using the `Geocoding API` to retrieve cities name, state, country, latitude and longitude
  - This will prompt you with a list of up to 5 locations based on your city name search query
  - The settings for location name, latitude and longitude will automatically be updated to the data from your selection
  - This should solve any issues with receiving data for the wrong city
- The weather string placeholders `%latitude%` and `%longitude%`
  - These values are returned from the API call and are not from the new settings for Latitude and Longitude
- `Air Pollution API` - This provides you with the current Air Quality Index with the corresponding placeholders
  - `%aqinumber%` - Numbers 1 to 5 which match with the strings below
  - `%aqistring%` - The strings that match the numbers 1 to 5 - 'Good', 'Fair', 'Moderate', 'Poor', 'Very Poor'
- Github repository links in the settings UI
